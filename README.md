# ZoomView
1. This project was implemented in 2000-2001 to expand the function of MFC(Microsoft Foundation Class)
2. The ZoomView is implemented based on MFC to provide some APIs for zooming a View to a limit of double value
The MFC provides a view with a limit range of integer value.
While in seismic data processing, we need to use coordinates that are are double values.
So that I created this Class to provide APIs to other applications to use.
3. The FHTreeView is a data tree to keep different kinds of data and easy for management and browsing .
4. There are many other usefull classes to expand MFC functions.
