# ZoomView
The ZoomView is implemented based on MFC to provide some APIs for zooming a View to a limit of double value
The MFC provides a view with a limit range of integer value.
While in seismic data processing, we need to use coordinates that are are double values.
So that I created this Class to provide APIs to other applications to use.
